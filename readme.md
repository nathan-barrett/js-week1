# BDD: Super Galactic Age Calculator

#### _Behavior Driven Development: Friday Project using Node.js, Bower, Gulp and Jasmine, November 17, 2017_

#### By _**Nathan Barrett**_

## Description
_This is an application which will (hopefully) calculate a user's age by comparing it to the current date and calculate that age and what it would be on different planets. To achieve this I will be using node.js, gulp, bower and several different node packages including: browserify, vinyl-source-stream, gulp-concat, uglify, gulp-util, del, jshint, browser-sync, bower, gulp-sass, gulp-sourcemaps, jasmine, karma, jasmine-core, karma-chrome-launcher, karma-cli, karma-browserify, babelify and a few extras.

## Setup/Installation Requirements
   * Node and Bower are installed on your machine globally
   * Knowledge of ES6 syntax

  ### Installation Instructions:
    1. Clone project from GitHub repository, by copying and pasting the url of this GitHub repository following the $git clone command into your favorite command line program, such as Terminal on Mac.
